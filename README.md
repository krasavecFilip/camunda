# CamundaTest

This project is a simple PoC of the Camunda project with Spring Boot.

## Description
The test process used is made of three tasks. The first and the third tasks are calling Java classes. The second one is waiting for an incoming message (e.g. emulating an asynchronous task).

## Todos
Currently the project isn't well integrated with the Spring Framework, as described here: https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/spring/embedded-process-engine/ .
